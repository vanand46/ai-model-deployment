# Spark Pipelines

**MLlib** is **Apache Spark’s machine learning library (ML library)**.  
While “Spark ML” is not an official name, it’s commonly used to refer to **MLlib’s DataFrame-based API**, which provides tools for building **machine learning pipelines**.

## Why Use Machine Learning in Spark?

There should be a **clear, logical reason** to use Spark for machine learning—especially since it requires more setup effort than libraries like **scikit-learn**.

Typically, organizations move to Spark for one key reason: **scale**.

- **Training at Scale**  
  Spark allows distributed training over large datasets stored in systems like **HDFS**, **S3**, or **Delta Lake**.  
  Because computations are executed **in parallel** across multiple nodes, training can be significantly faster than on a single-node setup.  

- **Prediction at Scale**  
  For production workloads serving **millions of requests**, Spark can parallelize predictions efficiently.

Note: The speedup is **not always guaranteed**. Distributed coordination introduces overhead, so performance depends on cluster size, data distribution, and algorithm type.

Despite the added complexity, Spark’s **ability to operate in a fully scalable environment** makes it a powerful choice for enterprise-level machine learning.

## Spark ML Pipelines Components

A **Spark ML Pipeline** is a structured way to build end-to-end machine learning workflows using reusable components.  

It is built on five key concepts:

### 1. DataFrame
The ML API uses **DataFrames** (from Spark SQL) as the core data structure.  
A DataFrame can hold a variety of data types — for example, a mix of continuous and categorical features.

### 2. Transformer
A **Transformer** is an algorithm that transforms one DataFrame into another.  
- Example: A trained ML model is a Transformer — it takes a DataFrame of input features and outputs a DataFrame of predictions.


### 3. Estimator
An **Estimator** is an algorithm that can be **fit** on a DataFrame to produce a Transformer.  
- Example: A learning algorithm like **LogisticRegression** or **RandomForest** is an Estimator.  
  After fitting, it produces a trained model (Transformer).


### 4. Pipeline
A **Pipeline** chains multiple Transformers and Estimators together to define an ML workflow.  
For example:

**Tokenizer → HashingTF → LogisticRegression**

Pipelines make the workflow **modular, reusable, and easier to manage**.

### 5. Parameter
All Transformers and Estimators share a **common API** for defining parameters.  
This consistency makes it easier to tune and track model configurations.

## Feature Extraction and Transformation

Feature extraction and transformation are integral parts of any **AI workflow**.  

In Spark, feature processing is supported through a wide variety of built-in **transformers** and **feature extractors**, similar to those in **scikit-learn**.

Some examples include:

| Category | Transformer / Feature |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Feature Selection** | Chi-Square Selector (`ChiSqSelector`) |
| **Feature Scaling** | StandardScaler |
| **Text Processing (NLP)** | TF-IDF (`HashingTF`, `IDF`), Word2Vec |


## Summary

Spark MLlib and its DataFrame-based API provide a scalable, production-grade approach to building and deploying machine learning models.  

While Spark may require more setup effort than local libraries, its **distributed computation**, **pipeline structure**, and **integration with big data ecosystems** make it ideal for:
- Large-scale model training
- Real-time predictions across clusters
- Enterprise AI deployments

By leveraging **Pipelines**, **Transformers**, and **Estimators**, data scientists can build **modular, maintainable, and scalable ML workflows** on top of Apache Spark.
